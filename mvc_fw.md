# MVC-frameworks

## Full-Stack Frameworks
The full-stack frameworks provide complete support to developers, including necessary elements such as form validation, form generators, and template layouts. Some of the common full-stack frameworks are:

### Web2py
* Cross-platform framework that provides support for Windows, Unix/Linux, Mac, Google App Engine, and many other platforms.
* No additional installation and configuration.
* Built-in components to handle HTTP requests, HTTP responses, cookies, and sessions as well.
* Ability to read multiple protocols.
* Security to data against all possible threats such as cross-site scripting, injection flaws, and execution of infected files.
* Follows model-view-controller (MVC) pattern.
* Support for role-based access control and internationalization.
* Allows users to embed jQuery for Ajax and UI effects.

### TurboGears
* Support for multiple databases.
* Follows an MVC pattern.
* Support for web servers such as Pylons.
* Numerous libraries.
* WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) components. For example, it uses ToscaWidgets, which enable developers to embed any complex widget in their application.

### CubicWeb
* Multiple databases, security workflows, and reusable components.
* Support for Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Resource Description Framework (RDF).
* Embeds Relational Query Language (RQL) in order to simplify the queries related to data.

## Non-full-stack Frameworks
The non-full-stack frameworks do not provide additional functionalities and features to the users. Developers need to add a lot of code and other things manually. 

### Bottle
* Built-in HTTP server.
* Adapters for third-party template engines and WSGI/HTTP servers.
* Allows users to access form data, file uploads, cookies, and other HTTP-related metadata in a much simpler way.
* Provides request-dispatching routes having URL-parameter support.
* Support for plugins of different databases.

### CherryPy
* Contains an HTTP/1.1-compliant, WSGI threaded-pooled web server. It provides support for different web servers as well, for example, Apache and IIS.
* Allows you to run several HTTP servers simultaneously.
* Contains some tools for events such as caching, encoding, authorization, etc. by default.
* Support for profiling, testing, and coverage by default.
* Built-in plugin system.

### Tornado
* Support for user authentication by default.
* Provides high-quality output.
* Non-blocking HTTP client.
* Allows you to implement third-party authentication and authorization schemes, such as Google OpenID/OAuth, Facebook login, Yahoo BBAuth, and Twitter OAuth.
